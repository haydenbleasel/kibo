description: What to do if you run into issues with Kibo UI.

## Why are my components not showing the correct styles?

Make sure your project is configured correctly for shadcn/ui in Tailwind 4 - this means having a `globals.css` file that imports Tailwind and includes the shadcn/ui base styles.

## I ran npx kibo-ui add but nothing was added to my project

Double-check that:

- Your current working directory is the root of your project (where package.json lives).
- Your components.json file (if using shadcn-style config) is set up correctly.
- You’re using the latest version of the Kibo CLI:

```bash
npx kibo-ui@latest
```

If all else fails, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/kibo/issues).

## Theme switching doesn’t work — my app stays in light mode

Ensure your app is using the same data-theme system that shadcn/ui and Kibo UI expect. The default implementation toggles a data-theme attribute on the `<html>` element. Make sure your tailwind.config.js is using class or data- selectors accordingly:

## The component imports fail with “module not found”

Check the file exists. If it does, make sure your `tsconfig.json` has a proper paths alias for `@/` i.e.

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./*"]
    }
  }
}
```
