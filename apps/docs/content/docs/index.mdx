## Introduction

Roadmap UI is a collection of accessible, customizable, performant and open source components for building interactive roadmaps.

These components share a common [data model](/docs/schema), allowing you to easily switch between them without losing data or re-implementing features.

The components are inspired by best-in-class tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Plane](https://plane.so/).
