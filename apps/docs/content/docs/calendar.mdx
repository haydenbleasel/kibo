<div className="not-prose w-full bg-white border rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
  <Calendar.Basic />
</div>

## Features

- Features are grouped by day
- Features are color-coded by their status
- Features are truncated if there are too many to fit in the grid cell

## Subcomponents

The calendar view is made up of the following subcomponents:

| Subcomponent | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| Provider | The provider of the calendar view. |
| Month | The month selector. |
| Header | The header of the calendar view, containing the day column headers. |
| Body | The body of the calendar view, containing the features. |

## Usage

### Basic Example

This example shows a basic calendar view with a month selector, header, and body.

<div className="not-prose w-full bg-white border rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
  <Calendar.Basic />
</div>

```tsx
import * as Calendar from '@repo/calendar';
import type { FC } from 'react';

export const Calendar: FC = () => (
  <Calendar.CalendarProvider>
    <Calendar.CalendarMonth />
    <Calendar.CalendarHeader />
    <Calendar.CalendarBody features={[]} />
  </Calendar.CalendarProvider>
);
```

### Without Month Selector

If you don't need the month selector, you can remove it by not rendering the `CalendarMonth` component.

<div className="not-prose w-full bg-white border rounded-xl overflow-hidden">
  <Calendar.WithoutMonth />
</div>

```tsx
import * as Calendar from '@repo/calendar';
import type { FC } from 'react';

export const Calendar: FC = () => (
  <Calendar.CalendarProvider>
    <Calendar.CalendarHeader />
    <Calendar.CalendarBody features={[]} />
  </Calendar.CalendarProvider>
);
```
