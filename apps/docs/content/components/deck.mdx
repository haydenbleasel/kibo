## API Reference

### Deck

The main container component that manages the swipeable card stack.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactElement[]` | - | Cards to display in the deck |
| `onSwipeLeft` | `(index: number) => void` | - | Callback when a card is swiped left |
| `onSwipeRight` | `(index: number) => void` | - | Callback when a card is swiped right |
| `onSwipeEnd` | `(index: number, direction: 'left' \| 'right') => void` | - | Callback when any swipe completes |
| `threshold` | `number` | `150` | Distance in pixels required to trigger a swipe |
| `stackSize` | `number` | `3` | Number of cards visible in the stack |
| `perspective` | `number` | `1000` | CSS perspective for 3D effect |
| `scale` | `number` | `0.05` | Scale factor between stacked cards |

### DeckItem

A convenience wrapper component for individual cards with default styling.

| Prop | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | - | Content of the card |
| `className` | `string` | - | Additional CSS classes |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { Deck, DeckItem } from '@repo/deck';

<Deck
  onSwipeLeft={(index) => console.log('Swiped left')}
  onSwipeRight={(index) => console.log('Swiped right')}
>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <DeckItem key={item.id}>
      <img src={item.image} alt={item.title} />
    </DeckItem>
  ))}
</Deck>
```

### Custom Cards

You don't need to use `DeckItem` - any React element can be a card:

```tsx
<Deck>
  {items.map((item) => (
    <div key={item.id} className="custom-card">
      {/* Your custom card content */}
    </div>
  ))}
</Deck>
```

### Programmatic Control

The component automatically progresses through cards on swipe. Track progress using the callback indices:

```tsx
const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

<Deck
  onSwipeEnd={(index) => setCurrentIndex(index + 1)}
>
  {/* cards */}
</Deck>
```

## Accessibility

- Cards are keyboard accessible via drag interactions
- Support for screen readers through proper ARIA labels
- Touch-friendly with appropriate hit targets
- Respects reduced motion preferences
