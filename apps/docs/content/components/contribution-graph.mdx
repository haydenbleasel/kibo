## Usage Tips

- For missing dates in the data array, no activity is assumed
- The calendar will automatically fill gaps between dates with zero activity
- You can control the calendar's date range by including empty entries as the first and last items
- The component automatically handles dark mode when using the system color scheme
- Use the `generateTestData()` helper function to quickly generate sample data for testing
