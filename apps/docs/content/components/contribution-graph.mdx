### ContributionGraphSkeleton

A convenience component that renders a loading skeleton.

## Types

### Activity

```typescript
interface Activity {
  date: string; // ISO 8601 date string (yyyy-MM-dd)
  count: number; // Amount of tracked data
  level: number; // Activity intensity (0 to maxLevel)
}
```

### Labels

```typescript
interface Labels {
  months?: string[];
  weekdays?: string[];
  totalCount?: string; // Supports {{count}} and {{year}} placeholders
  legend?: {
    less?: string;
    more?: string;
  };
}
```

### ThemeInput

```typescript
type ThemeInput =
  | {
      light: ColorScale | [from: Color, to: Color];
      dark?: ColorScale | [from: Color, to: Color];
    }
  | {
      light?: ColorScale | [from: Color, to: Color];
      dark: ColorScale | [from: Color, to: Color];
    };
```

## Usage Tips

- For missing dates in the data array, no activity is assumed
- The calendar will automatically fill gaps between dates with zero activity
- You can control the calendar's date range by including empty entries as the first and last items
- The component automatically handles dark mode when using the system color scheme
- Use the `generateTestData()` helper function to quickly generate sample data for testing
