description: A single, unified data model for all components.
---

Roadmap UI is built on top of a single, unified data model. This model is used to store the data for all components.

This allows you to easily switch between components without having to worry about the data model.

The aim of the model is to have as little data as possible, while still being able to represent all the data needed for the components.

This means that, while we don't have support for "Groups" for example, you can implement your own grouping and filtering logic on top of the data model.

## Feature

A feature is a single item on the roadmap. By default, it requires an ID, a name, a start and end date, and a status.

```ts
type Feature = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  startAt: Date;
  endAt: Date;
  status: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    color: string;
  };
};
```

## Marker

A marker is a single item on the timeline.

```ts
type Marker = {
  id: string;
  date: Date;
  label: string;
  backgroundColor: string;
  textColor: string;
};
```
