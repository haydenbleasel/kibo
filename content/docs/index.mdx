Roadmap UI is a collection of accessible, customizable, performant and open source components for building interactive roadmaps. These components share a common [data model](/schema), allowing you to easily switch between them without losing data or re-implementing features. The components are inspired by best-in-class tools like [Linear](https://linear.app/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) and [Plane](https://plane.so/).

To start using Roadmap UI in your project, start with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), then add the components you need from Roadmap UI using the `shadcn` CLI.

## Key Features

- **Accessibility**: Built with a focus on keyboard navigation and screen reader support.
- **Customization**: Easily theme and style components to match your brand.
- **Performance**: Optimized for smooth interactions, even with large datasets.
- **Open Source**: Free to use and modify under the MIT license.

## Components

Roadmap UI offers a variety of components to suit different roadmap visualization needs:

1. **Gantt Chart**: Visualize project schedules on a horizontal timeline.
2. **Kanban Board**: Organize work items into columns representing different stages.
3. **Calendar View**: Display projects and tasks on a grid calendar.
